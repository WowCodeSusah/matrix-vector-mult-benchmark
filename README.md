# Matrix Vector Multiplication Benchmark
The code runs by first running the makefile using make main to first create all the commands and then running ./main_test.exe to begin comparing the vektor method
with the naive method. This is to ensure the values are the same for both.

## Output

# Time Complexity
This part of the code is to check the time complexity of matrix vektor multiplication to run it simply first make time then ./main_b_time.exe with an integer value
the integer value is the size of the matrix.
## Output
